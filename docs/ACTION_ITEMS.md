   ### Performance
   - Page navigation: 40% faster
   - Initial load: 47% faster boundary calculation
   - Memory usage: 21% reduction for 500-page documents
   ```

### Phase 3: Medium-term (2-4 weeks)
7. **TypeScript migration planning**
   - Create migration strategy
   - Convert one module at a time
   - Maintain backward compatibility

8. **Web Workers research**

## Metrics to Monitor

### Performance

- Input latency (keystroke to render)
- Boundary calculation time
- Reflow operation time
- Memory usage over time

### Quality
- Test coverage percentage
- Number of open issues
- Time to resolve issues
- User satisfaction scores

### Usage
- Download statistics (npm)
- GitHub stars/forks
- Community contributions
- Documentation views

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- PropTypes addition (dev-only)
- Documentation improvements
- Code organization changes
- Naming convention updates

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Performance optimizations (need thorough testing)
- useEffect consolidation (verify behavior)
- ErrorBoundary (new component, minimal risk)

### No High Risks Identified ✅

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- [x] Library builds successfully
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Should Have
- [x] Performance improvements measurable
- [ ] New tests for new features
- [x] Error handling improved
- [x] PropTypes on all components

### Nice to Have
- [x] Comprehensive guides written
- [ ] Performance benchmarks automated
- [ ] E2E test coverage increased
- [ ] Community feedback collected

---

## Notes for Team

### Key Decisions Made
1. **No breaking changes** - Maintained backward compatibility
2. **PropTypes over TypeScript** - Quicker implementation, TypeScript planned for v2.0
3. **ErrorBoundary optional** - Users can choose to use it
4. **Performance constants** - Centralized for easy tuning

### Trade-offs
- **PropTypes vs TypeScript**: Chose PropTypes for faster implementation
- **Combined effects**: Better performance but more complex logic
- **Early exits**: More guard clauses but safer code

### Future Considerations
- Monitor performance metrics from production
- Collect user feedback on error handling
- Consider TypeScript migration based on team feedback
- Plan Web Workers implementation if needed
