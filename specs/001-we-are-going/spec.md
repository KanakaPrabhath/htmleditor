# Feature Specification: Multi-Page HTML Editor (Core Text Editing)

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-going`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We are going to develop a multi-page HTML editor. This WYSIWYG editor should be able edit and format text, image. This Editor should develop as a component so other software can use this HTML editor. This should have a common tool bar on top. Working is with multi pages with a4 size. (size can be changed). Page manager for add, delete pages. As the first feature we need to function edit text within multiple pages. Page breaks need to be added accordingly. Don't implement all features at once, create the first feature and test it and create the next feature after that. Use basic UI for now. This editor will create over 300 pages so make sure to work with large documents. No need to implement a user session, collaboration or comment or something like that."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want to edit text across multiple pages in an HTML editor so I can create long-form documents with proper page breaks and formatting.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new document with A4 page size, **When** I add text that exceeds one page, **Then** a page break is automatically inserted and a new page is created
2. **Given** a document with multiple pages, **When** I delete a page, **Then** the remaining pages reflow and maintain proper document structure
3. **Given** a document with 300+ pages, **When** I navigate between pages, **Then** the editor responds within 500ms

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a single paragraph spans multiple pages?
- How does the system handle extremely long documents (300+ pages)?
- What happens when the user changes page size mid-document?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a WYSIWYG interface for editing HTML content
- **FR-002**: System MUST support basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline, font size, font family)
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle page breaks automatically when content exceeds page boundaries
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain document structure when pages are added or deleted
- **FR-005**: System MUST support documents with up to 300 pages without performance degradation
- **FR-006**: System MUST render content in A4 page format by default with support for Letter (8.5x11") and Legal (8.5x14") sizes
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a consistent toolbar across all pages
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to change page size from the default A4 format
- **FR-010**: System MUST function as a component that can be integrated with other software applications
- **FR-011**: System MUST support both keyboard and mouse input for all editor functions

### Key Entities
- **Document**: Represents the entire multi-page content with metadata about page configuration
- **Page**: Represents a single page within the document with A4 size as default
- **ContentBlock**: Represents text or image content within a page with formatting information
- **PageBreak**: Represents the boundary between pages that may be automatically inserted or user-defined
