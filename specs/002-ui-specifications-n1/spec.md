## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want a familiar document editing interface with MS Word-like toolbar and layout so I can efficiently create professional documents without a learning curve.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** editor is open, **When** user selects text and clicks bold button, **Then** selected text appears in bold font weight
2. **Given** document contains headings, **When** user opens sidebar, **Then** document outline shows hierarchical structure of headings
3. **Given** document has content exceeding viewport, **When** user scrolls, **Then** infinite vertical scroll loads additional content smoothly
4. **Given** editor is in focus, **When** user presses Ctrl+B, **Then** selected text becomes bold without toolbar interaction

### Edge Cases
- What happens when document contains extremely long paragraphs with mixed formatting?
- How does system handle rapid toolbar interactions during animation transitions?
- Sidebar automatically collapses to 24px width below 1024px viewport width (matching FR-011 behavior)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Toolbar MUST provide dropdown menus for font family (Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Georgia, Verdana) and font size selection (8-72pt)
- **FR-002**: Toolbar MUST include formatting controls for bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough
- **FR-003**: Toolbar MUST support text alignment options (left, center, right, justify)
- **FR-004**: Toolbar MUST provide list creation tools (ordered, unordered, checklist)
- **FR-005**: Toolbar MUST include insert options for tables, images, and hyperlinks
- **FR-006**: Toolbar MUST feature undo/redo functionality with visual state indication
- **FR-007**: Document workspace MUST display content in a centered, white, paper-like editable area with shadow
- **FR-008**: Document workspace MUST support infinite vertical scrolling for long documents
- **FR-09**: System MUST respond appropriately to keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+U)
- **FR-010**: Interface MUST maintain usability across desktop and tablet screen sizes, with sidebar collapsing to narrow icon-only view (24px width) below 1024px
- **FR-011**: Toolbar MUST be positioned at the top of the document workspace with dark color scheme (Primary: #2D3748, Text: #FFFFFF) meeting WCAG AA contrast standards

### Key Entities
- **Document**: Represents the editable content with formatting properties, must maintain structural integrity during editing
- **Toolbar State**: Tracks active formatting options and selection context for consistent UI representation
- **Document Outline**: Hierarchical representation of document structure based on heading levels

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: For document workspace (FR-009), what exact dimensions should we use for the "page-like view with a4 paper dimensions"? ‚Üí A: A4 dimensions at 96 DPI: 794px √ó 1123px
- Q: For toolbar's dark color scheme (FR-013), what specific color values or WCAG contrast ratios are required? ‚Üí A: Primary: #2D3748, Text: #FFFFFF (AA compliant)
- Q: For toolbar animation behavior during rapid interactions (FR-012), should animations be interruptible? ‚Üí A: Animations must complete sequentially (no interruption)
