# Implementation Plan: Multi-Page Content Management

**Branch**: `003-editor-content-should` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: [specs/003-editor-content-should/spec.md](specs/003-editor-content-should/spec.md:line)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-editor-content-should/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → SUCCESS: Spec loaded from specs/003-editor-content-should/spec.md
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → SUCCESS: All clarifications resolved in spec
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → SUCCESS: Constitution check completed
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → SUCCESS: All gates passed
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → SUCCESS: research.md generated
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   → SUCCESS: All Phase 1 artifacts generated
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → SUCCESS: All gates passed
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → SUCCESS: Task planning approach documented
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Editor content should be manageable across multiple pages with automatic overflow handling and dynamic reflow. When content exceeds page capacity, it flows to new pages; when content is removed, subsequent content shifts up to eliminate blank pages. Unbreakable content (e.g., large images) creates new pages while leaving empty space on previous pages.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, Redux, ProseMirror  
**Storage**: Browser local storage for persistence, in-memory during editing  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (e2e)  
**Target Platform**: Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)  
**Project Type**: Web (frontend only)  
**Performance Goals**: Real-time reflow during editing (60fps)  
**Constraints**: Must handle unbreakable content by creating new pages  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user document editing  

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- I. Library-First: PASS - Implemented as standalone module in `src/lib/editor/page-management/`
- II. Component Integration: PASS - Editor component outputs standard HTML
- III. Test-First: PASS - Tests will be written before implementation (TDD)
- IV. Integration Testing: PASS - Integration tests will cover page reflow scenarios
- V. Observability: PASS - Structured logging added for reflow debugging
- VI. Versioning: N/A - Minor feature within same major version
- VII. Simplicity: PASS - Builds on existing page management, avoids over-engineering

**Structure Decision**: Web frontend project using React and Vite. Feature implemented in `src/lib/editor/page-management/` as a standalone module, with integration tests in `tests/integration/`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - Researched real-time content reflow in ProseMirror
   - Investigated handling of unbreakable content elements

2. **Research findings**:
   - ProseMirror's document model allows custom node views for page breaks
   - CSS columns approach rejected due to lack of per-page control
   - Custom layout engine rejected as premature optimization

3. **Consolidated findings** in [`research.md`](specs/003-editor-content-should/research.md:line):
   - Decision: Extend ProseMirror with custom page management
   - Rationale: Leverages existing infrastructure, maintains document integrity
   - Alternatives considered: CSS columns, custom layout engine

**Output**: [`research.md`](specs/003-editor-content-should/research.md:line) with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
1. **Entities from feature spec** → [`data-model.md`](specs/003-editor-content-should/data-model.md:line):
   - Document: { id, title, pages[], timestamps }
   - Page: { id, documentId, content[], pageNumber, isOverflowPage }
   - ContentBlock: { id, pageId, type, content, position, size }

2. **API contracts** → [`contracts/page-manager.js`](specs/003-editor-content-should/contracts/page-manager.js:line):
   ```js
   class PageManager {
     addContent(content, pageId)
     removeContent(blockId)
     reflow()
     getLayout()
   }
   ```

3. **Contract tests**:
   - Tests for PageManager interface in `tests/unit/page-management.test.js`

4. **Test scenarios** → [`quickstart.md`](specs/003-editor-content-should/quickstart.md:line):
   - 4 manual verification test cases covering all acceptance criteria

5. **Agent context updated** → [`.roo/context.md`](.roo/context.md:line):
   - Added feature context for multi-page content management

**Output**: [`data-model.md`](specs/003-editor-content-should/data-model.md:line), [`contracts/page-manager.js`](specs/003-editor-content-should/contracts/page-manager.js:line), failing tests, [`quickstart.md`](specs/003-editor-content-should/quickstart.md:line), [`.roo/context.md`](.roo/context.md:line)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs:
  - Each contract → contract test task [P]
  - Each entity → model creation task [P] 
  - Each user story → integration test task
  - Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
