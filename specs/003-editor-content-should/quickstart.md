# Quickstart: Multi-Page Content Management

## Manual Verification Steps

### Test Case 1: Content Overflow to New Page
1. Open the editor with a new document
2. Type content until the first page is completely filled
3. Continue typing additional content
4. **Expected Result**: Excess content automatically appears on a new page

### Test Case 2: Content Deletion and Page Elimination
1. Create a document with content spanning two pages
2. Select and delete all content on the first page
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - Content from second page shifts up to first page
   - Second page is automatically eliminated
   - No blank pages remain

### Test Case 3: Middle Section Deletion and Reflow
1. Create a document with content spanning three pages
2. Select and delete a large section from the middle of the document
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Subsequent content reflows to fill the space
   - Total page count reduces appropriately
   - No content gaps or overlaps

### Test Case 4: Unbreakable Content Handling
1. Insert a large image that exceeds page capacity
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Image appears on a new page
   - Previous page shows empty space where content couldn't fit
   - No content distortion occurs

## Expected Behavior Notes
- Reflow should happen in real-time during editing
- Page numbers should update automatically
- The editor should maintain smooth performance (60fps) during reflow
- All content should remain editable after reflow operations
