# Research: Multi-Page Content Management

## Real-time Content Reflow in ProseMirror

### Decision
Extend ProseMirror's document model with custom page management logic that handles content overflow and reflow.

### Rationale
ProseMirror is already the foundation of our editor, providing a robust document model and view system. By extending it with custom node views for page breaks, we can:
- Maintain a single document model
- Leverage ProseMirror's transaction system for changes
- Ensure compatibility with existing editor features
- Avoid reinventing the wheel for text editing

### Alternatives Considered
1. **CSS Columns**: 
   - *Pros*: Native browser implementation, simple to set up
   - *Cons*: No per-page control, cannot handle unbreakable content properly, limited customization
   - *Verdict*: Rejected - doesn't meet requirements for precise page control

2. **Custom Layout Engine**:
   - *Pros*: Complete control over layout
   - *Cons*: Significant development effort, potential performance issues, maintenance burden
   - *Verdict*: Rejected - violates "Simplicity" principle in constitution

## Handling Unbreakable Content

### Decision
When content exceeds page capacity (e.g., large images), create a new page for the element and leave empty space on the previous page.

### Rationale
This approach:
- Maintains document integrity (no content is truncated)
- Provides predictable behavior for users
- Aligns with user expectations from traditional word processors
- Is simpler to implement than trying to split unbreakable elements

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Content Scaling**:
   - *Pros*: Avoids empty space
   - *Cons*: Distorts content, poor user experience
   - *Verdict*: Rejected - violates user experience requirements

2. **Content Splitting**:
   - *Pros*: No empty space
   - *Cons*: Not possible for many content types (images, tables)
   - *Verdict*: Rejected - technically infeasible for unbreakable content

## Performance Considerations

### Decision
Implement reflow as a synchronous operation during editing with optimizations for large documents.

### Rationale
- Real-time feedback is critical for user experience
- Most documents will be small-to-medium size
- For large documents, we can implement incremental reflow in future iterations

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Debounced Reflow**:
   - *Pros*: Better performance for rapid typing
   - *Cons*: Delayed feedback, inconsistent user experience
   - *Verdict*: Rejected - violates "real-time" requirement

2. **Web Workers**:
   - *Pros*: Prevents UI blocking
   - *Cons*: Complex implementation, communication overhead
   - *Verdict*: Rejected - premature optimization for this feature
