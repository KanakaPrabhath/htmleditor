# Feature Specification: Multi-Page Content Management

**Feature Branch**: `003-editor-content-should`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Editor content should be manageable across multiple pages. When content overflows a page, it should automatically flow to the next page. Conversely, when content is removed, subsequent content should shift up to fill empty space, eliminating any resulting blank pages as necessary."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: content overflow, automatic page flow, dynamic reflow on deletion
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: unbreakable content handling]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Created 3 acceptance scenarios and 2 edge cases
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 5 requirements with 1 ambiguity marker
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Document, Page, Content Block defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Completed per template
- **Optional sections**: Key Entities included (data involved)
- All non-applicable sections removed

### For AI Generation
- Ambiguities marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- No guessing on unspecified behaviors
- Tester-focused requirements
- Common underspecified areas addressed

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a document creator, I need content to automatically flow between pages during editing so I can focus on content creation without manual page management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a document with content filling one page, **When** I add text exceeding page capacity, **Then** excess text automatically appears on the next page
2. **Given** a two-page document with content on both pages, **When** I delete all content on first page, **Then** second page content shifts up and blank page is eliminated
3. **Given** content spanning three pages, **When** I delete a large middle section, **Then** subsequent content reflows to fill space and total page count reduces

### Edge Cases
- Unbreakable content elements exceeding page capacity create new pages, leaving empty space on previous pages
- Rapid successive edits are processed immediately with no optimization to maintain real-time accuracy

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: How should the system handle unbreakable content elements (like large images) that exceed page capacity? ‚Üí A: Always create a new page for the element, leaving empty space on previous page
- Q: How should the system handle rapid successive edits causing multiple reflows? ‚Üí A: Process each edit immediately with no optimization

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically flow content to subsequent pages when current page capacity is exceeded
- **FR-002**: System MUST dynamically reflow content upward when content is removed, eliminating blank pages
- **FR-003**: System MUST create a new page for unbreakable content elements that exceed page capacity, leaving empty space on the previous page

### Key Entities
- **Document**: User-created content collection organized across pages
- **Page**: Container with defined capacity constraints holding content blocks
- **ContentBlock**: Editable unit (text/image) occupying space within pages
