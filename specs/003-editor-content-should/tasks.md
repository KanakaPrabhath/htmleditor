# Tasks: Multi-Page Content Management

## Feature Overview
Editor content should be manageable across multiple pages with automatic overflow handling and dynamic reflow. When content exceeds page capacity, it flows to new pages; when content is removed, subsequent content shifts up to eliminate blank pages. Unbreakable content (e.g., large images) creates new pages while leaving empty space on previous pages.

## Parallel Execution Guidance

### Can Be Executed in Parallel [P]
- T002, T003, T004, T005: Different model and contract tests (different files)
- T010, T011, T012, T013: Different integration test cases (can run in parallel despite same file)
- T017, T018: Performance tests and documentation (different concerns)

### Example Parallel Execution Commands
```
# Run all model and contract tests in parallel
roo task run T002 T003 T004 T005

# Run all integration test cases in parallel
roo task run T010 T011 T012 T013

# Run polish tasks in parallel
roo task run T017 T018
```

### Sequential Dependencies
- Models must be implemented before PageManager service (T006-T008 before T009)
- PageManager service must be implemented before integration tests (T009 before T010-T013)
- Integration tests must pass before UI integration (T010-T013 before T014)
- Reflow functionality must be implemented before unbreakable content handling (T015 before T016)

## Implementation Notes
- All new code must be added to `src/lib/editor/page-management/` as specified in the plan
- Follow TDD approach: write tests before implementation
- Maintain 60fps performance target during reflow operations
- Ensure unbreakable content creates new pages while leaving empty space on previous pages
- All changes must pass existing test suite before submission
