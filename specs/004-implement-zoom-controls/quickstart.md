# Quickstart: Implement Zoom Controls and Enhance Page Size Selection

## Overview
This feature adds zoom controls to the HTML editor, allowing users to scale the document view from 50% to 200% in 25% increments. Page sizes are enhanced to match real-world dimensions at 100% zoom.

## Basic Usage

### Zoom Controls
1. Open the HTML editor in the demo app
2. Use the zoom buttons in the page manager at the bottom:
   - **+** button: Increase zoom by 25%
   - **-** button: Decrease zoom by 25%
   - **100%** button: Reset to 100% zoom
3. Current zoom level is displayed between the buttons

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl + Plus (+)**: Zoom in
- **Ctrl + Minus (-)**: Zoom out
- **Ctrl + 0**: Reset to 100% zoom

### Page Size Selection
1. Page sizes (A4, Letter, Legal) now display at true-to-life dimensions when zoomed to 100%
2. Changing page size automatically adjusts boundaries and reflow

## Validation
- Zoom levels: 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%
- Page boundaries maintain accuracy at all zoom levels
- Performance remains smooth during zoom changes
- Reflow operations complete within 500ms

## Testing
Run the following to validate:
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "zoom"
npm run test:unit -- --grep "zoom"
