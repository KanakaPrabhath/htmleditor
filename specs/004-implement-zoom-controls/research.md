# Research: Implement Zoom Controls and Enhance Page Size Selection

## Research Tasks Completed

### Zoom Implementation in React
**Decision**: Use CSS transform: scale() on the content container for zoom functionality.
**Rationale**: Provides smooth scaling without affecting layout calculations, maintains performance with hardware acceleration.
**Alternatives Considered**: Canvas-based rendering (rejected due to complexity), individual element scaling (rejected due to reflow issues).

### Page Size Matching Real Dimensions
**Decision**: Calculate pixel dimensions based on real page sizes (e.g., A4 = 210mm x 297mm â‰ˆ 794px x 1123px at 96 DPI).
**Rationale**: Ensures 100% zoom displays true-to-life page sizes in the browser.
**Alternatives Considered**: Fixed pixel sizes (rejected due to inconsistency), user-configurable DPI (overkill for this scope).

### Zoom State Management
**Decision**: Add zoom level to DocumentContext state, with actions for setZoom, zoomIn, zoomOut.
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing state management pattern, allows global access.
**Alternatives Considered**: Local component state (rejected due to need for persistence), URL params (not necessary).

### Keyboard Shortcuts
**Decision**: Use window event listeners for Ctrl+Plus, Ctrl+Minus, Ctrl+0.
**Rationale**: Standard zoom shortcuts, prevents conflicts with contenteditable.
**Alternatives Considered**: Custom shortcuts (rejected for UX consistency).

### Boundary Calculations with Zoom
**Decision**: Adjust boundary calculations by dividing pixel measurements by zoom factor.
**Rationale**: Maintains accurate page breaks and reflow at different zoom levels.
**Alternatives Considered**: Fixed boundaries (rejected due to zoom distortion).

### Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Debounce boundary recalculations, use transform3d for GPU acceleration.
**Rationale**: Maintains 60fps during zoom changes and typing.
**Alternatives Considered**: Throttling (less responsive), no optimization (performance issues).</content>
