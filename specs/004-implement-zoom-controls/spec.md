# Feature Specification: Implement Zoom Controls and Enhance Page Size Selection

**Feature Branch**: `004-implement-zoom-controls`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement zoom controls and enhance page size selection in the HTML editor. Requirements Add zoom in/out buttons to the page manger at bottom Display current zoom level (e.g., 100%, 125%, etc.) Allow zoom levels from 50% to 200% in 25% increments Ensure zoom affects the continuous page view properly Maintain page boundaries and reflow behavior at different zoom levels Add keyboard shortcuts for zoom (Ctrl+Plus, Ctrl+Minus, Ctrl+0 for reset) Implementation Notes Update page manger component to include zoom controls Modify ContinuousPageView to support zoom scaling Update useContinuousReflow hook to handle zoom in boundary calculations Ensure performance remains smooth at different zoom levels"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What specific enhancements are needed for page size selection in the HTML editor? ‚Üí A: Page size in editor should equal real page size selected

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a document editor user, I want to zoom in and out of the document view to adjust the content size for better readability and editing at different scales.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the editor is displaying a document, **When** I click the zoom in button, **Then** the zoom level increases by 5% and the view scales accordingly.
2. **Given** the editor is at 100% zoom, **When** I press Ctrl+Plus, **Then** the zoom level becomes 105%.
3. **Given** the editor is at 200% zoom, **When** I click zoom out, **Then** the zoom level becomes 195%.
4. **Given** the editor is at any zoom level, **When** I press Ctrl+0, **Then** the zoom resets to 100%.
5. **Given** the editor has content that spans multiple pages, **When** I change zoom level, **Then** page boundaries and reflow behavior are maintained.
6. **Given** the editor is at 50% zoom, **When** I attempt to zoom out further, **Then** the zoom level remains at 50% or the button is disabled.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when zoom is at 50% and user tries to zoom out? (Button should be disabled or do nothing)
- How does zoom affect very large documents with many pages? (Performance must meet FR-007 requirements)
- What if user uses keyboard shortcuts while the editor is not focused? (Shortcuts should work when editor has focus)
- How does zoom interact with page size changes? (When page size changes at any zoom level, boundaries recalculate within 100ms and reflow completes within 500ms)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide zoom in and zoom out buttons in the page manager at the bottom.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the current zoom level (e.g., 100%, 125%, etc.).
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow zoom levels from 50% to 200% in 5% increments.
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply zoom scaling to the continuous page view while maintaining page boundaries and reflow behavior.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Plus for zoom in, Ctrl+Minus for zoom out, Ctrl+0 for reset. Shortcuts must work when the editor has focus and not conflict with content editing operations.
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain 60fps during zoom operations and complete reflow within 500ms for documents up to 500 pages.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure that the page size displayed in the editor matches the real-world page size selected by the user.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Zoom Level**: Represents the current scaling percentage for the document view, with allowed values of 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 105%, 110%, 115%, 120%, 125%, 130%, 135%, 140%, 145%, 150%, 155%, 160%, 165%, 170%, 175%, 180%, 185%, 190%, 195%, 200%.
- **Page Size**: Defines the dimensions of the document page (e.g., A4, Letter, Legal), used for layout and boundary calculations.
